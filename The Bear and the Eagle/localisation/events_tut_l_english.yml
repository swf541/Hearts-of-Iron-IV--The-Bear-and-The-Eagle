 tutorial.1000.t:0 "Cold War: The Iron Curtain"
 tutorial.1000.d:0 "Welcome to the Cold War: The Iron Curtain mod. We would like to go over some of the new mechanics and content we have added to this mod."
 tutorial.1000.a:0 "Teach me the new mechanics."
 tutorial.1000.b:0 "I already know how to play."
 
 tutorial.1.t:0 "Tutorial Menu"
 tutorial.1.d:0 "Choose which subject you would like to learn about in this mod."
 tutorial.1.a:0 "Teach me about DEFCON."
 tutorial.1.b:0 "Teach me about nuclear missiles."
 tutorial.1.c:0 "Teach me about helicopters."
 tutorial.1.e:0 "I don't need to learn anything else."
 
 tutorial.go:0 "Go on."
 tutorial.back:0 "Go Back."
 tutorial.menu:0 "Return to menu."
 
 tutorial.11.t:0 "DEFCON Menu"
 tutorial.11.d:0 "DEFCON is a new mechanic introduced to our mod, and can be confusing to understand. DEFCON now affects how you declare war or how to interact militarily with other countries."
 tutorial.12.t:0 "DEFCON V"
 tutorial.12.d:0 "First, we have DEFCON 5. This means peacetime and has the lowest amount of war action you can do. DEFCON 5 is already selected for you and it already affects what you can do militarily. You will not be able to declare war at all until you either reach 50% world tension or get an event that gets war declared on you or you declaring war on a country. An example would be the Korean War happening and the US being called in. This would unlock DEFCON 3 for use. Proxy wars are more important now as you can't fully declare war, but you can still send land-lease or send volunteers."
 
 tutorial.13.t:0 "DEFCON IV"
 tutorial.13.d:0 "DEFCON 4 is unlocked when there is more than 25% world tension. You can send more volunteers and lend lease to your proxy wars. You can also influence countries more and more with each DEFCON."
 tutorial.14.t:0 "DEFCON III"
 tutorial.14.d:0 "DEFCON 3 is when things start getting serious. You can only activate DEFCON 3 while at war (not a World War, but a proxy war for example. You must have more than 50% world tension. With DEFCON 3 you can now send more and more lend lease and volunteers, but you can now declare your own wars. With DEFCON 2, you need 75% or more World Tension."
 tutorial.15.t:0 "DEFCON II"
 tutorial.15.d:0 "DEFCON 2 can let you send a lot more volunteers and lend lease, and also makes CBs and wars even cheaper. DEFCON 1 requires more than 95% world tension to unlock."
 tutorial.16.t:0 "DEFCON I"
 tutorial.16.d:0 "DEFCON 1 can let you send the max amount of volunteers and lend lease, while declaring your own wars even cheaper. This causes total war and likely ends the world for you as World War III will break out."
 tutorial.17.t:0 "DEFCON: Conclusion"
 tutorial.17.d:0 "Theses are the steps on how it works and we hope this tutorial helps you with it, now go play Global Thermonuclear War!\n\n\n-From the Cold War: Iron Curtain Dev Team"
 
 tutorial.22.t:0 "Nuclear Missiles"
 tutorial.22.d:0 "'Nuclear missiles' is a new mechanic introduced to our mod, and can be confusing to understand. There are 2 types of nuclear bombs: Atomic Fission (Atomic Bombs) and Atomic Fusion (Hydrogen Bombs) and 4 types for nuclear missiles: Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM), Short-Ranged Ballistic Missile (SRBM), Intermediate-Ranged Ballistic Missile (IRBM), and Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)."
 tutorial.23.t:0 "Nuclear Missiles II"
 tutorial.23.d:0 "SLBMs can be launched from anywhere in the world from ballistic submarines. SRBMs are short range missiles and only have a few hundred kilometers of range. (Example: West Germany to Western Poland). IRBMs range from several hundred kilometers to a couple thousand. (Example: Eastern France to Moscow). ICBMs can virtually hit anything around the world. (Example: Eastern US to West Russia). Here is how to build and work with Nuclear Missiles:"
 tutorial.24.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 1."
 tutorial.24.d:0 "Step 1. Once you open the research tab you will see the tab at the far end. The radioactive symbol is the WMD tree tab. Click it and it will take you to the WMD tree."
 tutorial.25.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 2."
 tutorial.25.d:0 "Step 2. Once you get on the WMD tab you will see all of the missiles and bombs. Now click to research a missile or bomb. For this we will use a missile."
 tutorial.26.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 3."
 tutorial.26.d:0 "Step 3. Once you research a missile, you go go to the production tab. Once there, all missiles and bombs are classified under planes. Once you do that you then build the missile you want."
 tutorial.27.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 4."
 tutorial.27.d:0 "Step 4. After missiles finish being built, you then need to find where they are. They will spawn at airfields and you can position them at airfields wherever you want. You create a new air wing and they will form."
 tutorial.28.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 5."
 tutorial.28.d:0 "Step 5. Now once you placed them at a airfield you can hover over the airfield and see the missile's range. That is as far they can go. If you want a bigger range, research a later tech class of them or research a bigger missile with a bigger range."
 tutorial.29.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 6 (SLBM)."
 tutorial.29.d:0 "(Optional/Only for SLBMs) Step 6. For SRBMs they act like naval planes for aircraft carriers. You have to build a new class of submarine. This class is Ballistic Submarine. Then you do what you regularly do for planes on aircraft carriers and add them there."
 tutorial.30.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 7."
 tutorial.30.d:0 "Step 7. Once you do these steps you are now available to do global thermonuclear war. To do this just click on a province and the vanilla nuclear button will be there. That will send the missile to the province and KABOOM, a nuclear blast goes off and nuclear war begins."
 tutorial.31.t:0 "Nuclear Missile Conclusion"
 tutorial.31.d:0 "Those are the steps on how they work; we hope this tutorial helped you, now go cause Armageddon on the world!\n\n\n-From the Cold War: Iron Curtain Dev Team"
 
 tutorial.33.t:0 "Helicopters"
 tutorial.33.d:0 "Helicopters are a new mechanic introduced to our mod, and can be confusing to understand. There is 4 types of helicopters: Cargo, Utility, Attack, Light Attack/Scout, and ASW."
 
 tutorial.34.t:0 "Cargo"
 tutorial.34.d:0 "Cargo deals with supply transport and making sure your troops are supplied."
 
 tutorial.35.t:0 "Utility"
 tutorial.35.d:0 "Utility deals with transporting troops over short distances and move fast and deal a bit of damage due to door guns and gun pods on them.  Utility will also make up a new Air Cavalry Division template."
 
 tutorial.36.t:0 "Attack"
 tutorial.36.d:0 "Attack helicopters attack ground units and deal some damage to air units.  Attack helicopters are also part of division templates and will give buffs to attack."
 
 tutorial.37.t:0 "Light Attack/Scout"
 tutorial.37.d:0 "Light Attack/Scout mostly deal with recon but can deal some light damage to ground units. Scout helicopters are really fast due to them being light."
 
 tutorial.38.t:0 "Anti Submarine Warfare"
 tutorial.38.d:0 "ASW deals with attacking naval ships or submarines and is the only helicopter that could attack naval units. ASW helicopters attach to Helicopter Carriers and regular Carriers, though you can't fit a lot on regular carriers."
 tutorial.39.t:0 "Helicopters II"
 tutorial.39.d:0 "helicopters may be fast and cheaper to produce, they are easier to take out due to them not being as fast as planes. So choose wisely on what you would want to do."
 tutorial.40.t:0 "Helicopters Conclusion"
 tutorial.40.d:0 "Those are the steps on how it works and we hope this tutorial helps you, now go play Fortune Son in a helicopter!\n\n\n-From the Cold War: Iron Curtain Dev Team"
