Because a lot of people have been complaining about it, we now give you the possibility to annex the Soviet SSRs.\n\nBUT BE AWARE: This will disable the SSRs' focus trees and therefore not fire their potential breakup events. If you own the TFV-DLC, please keep the SSRs, it will not change your gameplay and they can be annex through it. Some lag is expected when you choose to annex.\n\nHave fun!\n - Your CW:TIC Devteam"
