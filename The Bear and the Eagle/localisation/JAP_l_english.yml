 royal.2.d:0 "Just this afternoon, a public broadcast in the Tokyo Imperial Palace was held, with the royal family being held by several guards with firearms. At the forefront, centered on the screen, was Yakov Alexandrovich Malik, a middle aged Soviet Ambassador, with pistol in hand. The acts of the Japanese royal family have led to countless deaths during the second great war, for every action, there is a price to pay. Emperor Hirohito, on the counts of conspiracy to seize power, waging wars of aggression, comission of war crimes, and crimes against humanity, i sentence you, and the entire royal family to death, for this state is to be cleansed and start anew. The United states and Commonwealth, including several neutral nations have already condemned the publicly broadcasted execution that included women and children. Stalin and his communists must apologise for this barbarous act, children are innocent and must be protected. said President Truman, during a press conference."
 royal.1.d:0 "Emperor Hirohito has just announced his abdication this morning, as to everyone's shock. Emotions and Opinion mixed from nation to nation, the JCP did not waste time to support the Emperor's decision. The United States President Harry S. Truman, reacted in a press conference by subtly proposing that a third party must have had a hand in this decision. While the United Kingdom stayed surprisingly neutral, and the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China both supporting and critisizing the Emperor's decision respectively. As expected, the USSR strongly supported the abdication, several diplomats comenting that they believe NATO is going to go paranoid over this. Days later, the President of the United states accused the JCP to have been a third party to possibly force the abdication, Allegations were quickly denied by the JCP. The USSR made comments about the americans spreading conspiracy and fear to further de-stabilize the asian regions.."
 royal.3.d:0 "Yesterday, an unscheduled international broadcast over Television and radio surprised everyone, as communist-like music played for a few seconds, to which after, what looked like the Japanese Royal family Emperor Hirohito and his bride, and several other men, women, and even children were lined up on elevated wooden gallows, each with a noose around their necks at the Beijing Imperial Palace, also known as the Forbidden City. A young man wearing a PLA officer uniform stood behind a pedestal, as another officer was prepared to pull a lever. For crimes against mainland China, for crimes against our people, for crimes of giving our prisoners death without honor, for crimes agaisnt humanity and the state, we, the communist party of China, by Orders of Chairman Mao Zedong, sentence you and your entire family to hang, until death is confirmed, here at the Forbidden City. Multiple NATO countries were quick to react to this broadcast, strongly condemning the questionable actions of the PRC, some even calling for retaliation. The United States were quick to blame the USSR for helping of the execution, to which the USSR was quick to dismiss the baseless accusations as there were no soviets present, only asians. Mongolia and the Republic of China in particular has closed their borders to the PRC following the traumatic events."
 treaty_san_francisco.1.d:0 "On September 8, 1951, the San Francisco Peace Treaty was officially signed by 48 nations mostly between Japan and the Allied Powers, and came into force on April 28, 1952. This treaty served to officially end Japan's position as an imperial power, to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, and to end the American-led Allied post-war occupation of Japan and return sovereignty to that nation. This treaty made extensive use of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States and the United Kingdom. The Soviet delegation made several unsuccessful procedural attempts to stall the proceedings. The Soviet Union's objections were detailed in a lengthy September 8, 1951 statement by Gromyko. This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is still undetermined."
