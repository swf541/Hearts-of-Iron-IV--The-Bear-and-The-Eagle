 nato.9.t:0 "Isolationism or Internationalism?"
 nato.9.d:0 "As part of one of my campaign promises, I promised to pull the United States out of NATO and less intervention in the world. We need to have less intervention in the world, and return to our isolationist state like before World War II. However this may leave Europe vulnerable to the hordes of communism, and will make the USSR have an open world to spread its communist ideals. If we stay isolationist, then we hopefully won’t be dragged into a World War III. What should US foreign policy be?"
 nato.9.b:0 "Communism has become too much a threat. Internationalism is needed."
 nato.9.a:0 "Isolationism is needed for peace."

 nato.10.t:0 "America Leaves NATO"
 nato.10.d:0 "US President Taft has announced the removal of America from NATO. The US said they want to return to their isolationist policies from before World War II. With the US removing themselves from NATO, we are now a much weaker alliance. The USSR will have an easier time spreading their influence around the world. We need to decide if we stay in the NATO alliance and hold what we can hold from the USSR, or we need to remove ourselves and defend ourselves. If we stay, the United Kingdom will be the alliance leader due to them having the biggest military other than America.  We need to make a decision about the future of the alliance."

Other members of NATO are shocked and are now in an emergency council to discuss the future of NATO and the Free World. The USSR has said that they wish the best for the USA and also said that their isolationist policies will help the world. What will happen to the Free World?"
