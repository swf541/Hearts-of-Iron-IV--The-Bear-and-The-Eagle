 raj.2.t:0 "India Declares War!"

 raj.5.t:0 "Referendum for Pondicherry"
 raj.5.d:0 "India and France, following talks, issued a joint statement on October 13, 1954 announcing a procedure for deciding the status of the French settlements. Five days later, on 18 October 1954 the elected members of the Representative Assembly and the municipal councillors of Pondicherry and Karaikkal took part in a referendum at Kizhur. Of the 178 members voting, an overwhelming majority of 170 members favoured the merger of French Indian territories with the Republic of India. Three days later, an agreement on the de facto transfer of the French territories to India was signed in New Delhi between the two countries."

 raj.7.t:0 "Demand Goa"
 raj.7.d:0 "For years we have been trying to peacefully take back Goa from the hands of their imperial oppressors but to no avail. Goa has been part of India for thousands of years and for Portugal to claim that it is an integral part of their country is just absurd. Portugal has been staunchly holding onto their colonies in Africa and all over the world for years after the great war, and it seems like they have no intention of letting any of them go. It appears that our peaceful attempts have failed and we might have to resort to more violent means..."
 raj.7.a:0 "Goa is Indian! Launch Operation Vijay!"
 raj.7.b:0 "We will settle this diplomatically, end of story."
 raj.8.t:0 "War with India!"
 raj.8.d:0 "Prime Minister! India has savagely declared war on us! They claim that Goa is Indian territory while we know that it is Portuguese! We have strengthened our military forces in Portuguese Goa, however, the Indians outnumber us severely. Shall we send reinforcements?"
 raj.8.a:0 "Yes! Send reinforcements in now!"
