 berlincrisis.1.t:0 "Berlin Crisis"
 berlincrisis.1.d:0 "At the Vienna summit on 4 June 1961, tensions rose. Meeting with US President John F. Kennedy, Premier Khrushchev reissued the Soviet ultimatum to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany and thus end the existing four-power agreements guaranteeing American, British, and French rights to access West Berlin and the occupation of East Berlin by Soviet forces. The three powers responded that any unilateral treaty could not affect their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin. In the growing confrontation over the status of Berlin, Kennedy undercut his own bargaining position during his Vienna summit negotiations with Khrushchev in June 1961. Kennedy essentially conveyed US acquiescence to the permanent division of Berlin. This made his later, more assertive public statements less credible to the Soviets. What should we do about the Berlin Question?"
 berlincrisis.1.a:0 "Hold a NATO summit about disarming West Berlin"
 berlincrisis.1.b:0 "We will not give them inch of land"
 berlincrisis.2.t:0 "NATO pulling out of West Berlin"
 berlincrisis.2.d:0 "After talks in the Vienna Summit, the Soviet Union gave NATO a ultimatum to decide about the Berlin Question. The Soviets want West Berlin to be incorporated back in East Berlin and it to be a unified city under the German Democratic Republic. A NATO summit began a couple of weeks ago, and after talks NATO has decided to pull out of West Berlin. NATO made a statement saying that the World can not be pulled into World War III because of a divided city. The American, French, and British troops stationed in West Berlin are being pulled out and thousands of civilians are trying to get out. Many experts critisized this decision as this radically expands the USSR's sphere of influence, but at least the Berlin Crisis has come to an end."
 berlincrisis.2.a:0 "Hopefully this will prevent World War III."
 berlincrisis.2.b:0 "A victory for Communism."
 berlincrisis.2.c:0 "World War III has been averted."
 berlincrisis.3.t:0 "NATO refused Soviet offer"
 berlincrisis.3.d:0 "As the confrontation over Berlin escalated, Kennedy, in a speech delivered on nationwide television the night of 25 July, reiterated that the United States was not looking for a fight and that he recognised the "Soviet Union's historical concerns about their security in central and eastern Europe." He said he was willing to renew talks, but he also announced that he would ask Congress for an additional $3.25 billion for military spending, mostly on conventional weapons. He wanted six new divisions for the Army and two for the Marines, and he announced plans to triple the draft and to call up the reserves. Kennedy proclaimed: "We seek peace, but we shall not surrender." The same day, Kennedy requested an increase in the Army's strength from 875,000 to approximately 1 million, an increase of 29,000 and 63,000 men in the active duty Navy and Air Force, respectively, and the authority to bring some reserve units into active duty. Vacationing in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Khrushchev was reported to be angered by Kennedy's speech. John Jay McCloy, Kennedy's disarmament adviser, who happened to be in the Soviet Union, was invited to join Khrushchev. It is reported that Khrushchev explained to McCloy that Kennedy's military build-up threatened war."

 berlincrisis.3.c:0 "Tensions will get high."
 berlincrisis.4.t:0 "NATO says no to Berlin Question"
 berlincrisis.4.d:0 "NATO has said no to the ultimatum. Stating that it breaks the rules of the Big 4 Accords signed in 1946. The Americans, british and french said they will not give up any land to the Communists. The East German government are asking about their next move. What should our next move be? We could put pressure on the West by deploying our tanks and troops right on the border, or we could just accept their decision."
 berlincrisis.4.a:0 "A military option will work."
 berlincrisis.4.b:0 "We will allow this decision to stay."
 berlincrisis.5.t:0 "Berlin Crisis Gets Hotter"
 berlincrisis.5.d:0 "The Soviet Union is displeased by NATO not accepting the ultimatum, stating the the Motherland sacrificed millions of lives to get to berlin. They said that the Western powers will cause World War III if they do not leave Berlin, and in consequence will cause the deaths of billions. Tensions are high in Berlin and Soviet tanks and troops are right across from our tanks and soldiers. What should we do?"
 berlincrisis.5.a:0 "This is an attack!"
 berlincrisis.5.b:0 "Send a diplomat to talk to the USSR."
 berlincrisis.5.c:0 "Pull back our tanks and soldiers."
 berlincrisis.6.t:0 "World War III breaks out"
 berlincrisis.6.d:0 "After weeks of talks and rising tensions between NATO and the Comminform, diplomats have failed to come to an understanding, where it came to a point where they were launching insults at each other. Reports are coming in that Berlin is once again under siege, Cannonfire and gunfire could be heard for miles away, Fighters and bombers scrambling and Navies leaving their docks. Countries from around the world have mobilised their troops once again. World War III has started, but the only question we have is that will it be a conventional war or a nuclear war?"
 berlincrisis.6.a:0 "God help us."
 berlincrisis.7.t:0 "Talks in the Berlin Crisis"
 berlincrisis.7.d:0 "The United States have sent a diplomat to the USSR to talk about the Berlin Crisis in response to russian threats of military action. Both sides are trying to keep tensions low, but difficulties keep arrising with the Soviets declaring that NATO does not belong in Berlin, and NATO disagreeing for international security reasons. Hopefully the Berlin Crisis will be solved here and that the World doesn't enter World War III."
 berlincrisis.7.a:0 "We'll end this and keep West Berlin."
 berlincrisis.7.b:0 "We'll end this and get West Berlin."
 berlincrisis.7.c:0 "Let's hope this ends soon."
 berlincrisis.8.t:0 "Berlin Question Talks"
 berlincrisis.8.d:0 "Tensions are at the highest in the world right now. The American Government has sent a diplomat to have talks with us about the Berlin Question. The World is watching us in these talks. We will negotiate with the Americans about what to do. What should we focus on in the talks?"
 berlincrisis.8.a:0 "Push for a reunified Berlin."

 berlincrisis.9.t:0 "Negotiations of Berlin"
 berlincrisis.9.d:0 "The Soviets want West Berlin and East Berlin to be reunited into Berlin. They want it to be under GDR control with no occupation forces. Berlin will be a Demilitarized Zone too.

 berlincrisis.9.a:0 "Accept the deal."
 berlincrisis.9.b:0 "Berlin will stay divided."
 berlincrisis.10.t:0 "West and East Berlin Unified!"
 berlincrisis.10.d:0 "After weeks of debate and heated arguments, NATO has agreed to pull out of West Berlin, and to give East Germany West Berlin. The Soviets have called this a great victory for World peace. NATO said in a statement that World War II ended years ago, and that West Berlin shouldn't be a reminder to the people living there that they are still occupied. Some critics of NATO have called this a bad move from NATO stating that this will expand the communist sphere of influence."
 berlincrisis.10.a:0 "We don't need to occupy West Berlin."
 berlincrisis.10.b:0 "A great victory for the Warsaw Pact."
 berlincrisis.10.c:0 "Will the relations warm up now?"
 berlincrisis.11.t:0 "Soviets Push for a Free City of Berlin"
 berlincrisis.11.d:0 "The Soviets have said that if NATO won't accept a unified city of Berlin controlled by the GDR, then maybe we could form a Free City of Berlin. The Free City of Berlin would include both West and East Berlin, and would be a neutral state. The problem with this, however, is that the Soviets could influence the neutral Berlin country. What should we do about this?"
 berlincrisis.11.a:0 "Allow the Free City of Berlin."
 berlincrisis.11.b:0 "We are not going to give up our land."
 berlincrisis.12.t:0 "Free City of Berlin Formed!"
 berlincrisis.12.d:0 "The USA and USSR has agreed on a independent city state in Berlin. The city state will be neutral and will not be with any alliance. This is sure to not last long, since Berlin is a strategic location for NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  The Americans, Soviets, French, and British have started pulling out their forces. The DDR and the FRG have strongly voiced their opinions on the city state and have said that they will once again be part of a unified German state."
 berlincrisis.12.a:0 "Hopefully this crisis is over with."
 berlincrisis.12.b:0 "The state will be under our control soon."
 berlincrisis.12.c:0 "What will happen now?"
 berlincrisis.13.t:0 "Soviets and Americans pull back troops from Berlin Border"
 berlincrisis.13.d:0 "With KGB spy Georgi Bolshakov serving as the primary channel of communication, Khrushchev and Kennedy agreed to reduce tensions by withdrawing the tanks. The Soviet checkpoint had direct communications to General Anatoly Gribkov at the Soviet Army High Command, who in turn was on the phone to Khrushchev. The US checkpoint contained a Military Police officer on the telephone to the HQ of the US Military Mission in Berlin, which in turn was in communication with the White House. Kennedy offered to go easy over Berlin in the future in return for the Soviets removing their tanks first. The Soviets agreed. Kennedy stated concerning the Wall "It's not a very nice solution, but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war." A Soviet tank moved about 5 metres backwards first; then an American tank followed suit. One by one the tanks withdrew."
 berlincrisis.13.a:0 "We have succeeded in keeping West Berlin."
 berlincrisis.13.b:0 "We will get West Berlin another time."

 SOV_khruschev_reforms_desc:0 "Stalin's death in 1953 triggered a power struggle, from which Khrushchev emerged victorious. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th Party Congress, he delivered the "Secret Speech", which denounced Stalin's purges and ushered in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces."
 SOV_de_stalinization_desc:0 "In 1953, after the death of Stalin, Khruschev worked to remove the Stalinist terror from the population and from the country, as such, he took measures such as the removal of the Cult of Personality lead by Stalin and the Stalinist political system, we must be free from such terrible influences who distort the vision of true communism."
 SOV_the_secret_speech_desc:0 "In 1956, Khruschev heavily criticized the deceased Comrade Stalin on his purges executed in the 1930s and criticized his great faults in creating a cult of personality instead of fostering communism for the Soviet worker, the speech heavily influenced the Sino-Soviet split and the weakening of the Soviet political sphere everywhere on the planet"
 SOV_sino_soviet_split_desc:0 "After the publishing of the secret speech by Khruschev in 1956, Mao denounced Khruschev as a revisionist for his criticizing views on Stalinism, which formed the basis for many communist systems all over the globe, and the split heavily weakened the USSR, as it was losing one of it's most important allies and economical partners in the planet"
 SOV_peaceful_coexistence_desc:0 "In the 20th Party Congress, Khruschev defended and solidified the concept of coexistence with the USA, after great rising tensions of nuclear warfare. The proclamation meant the end of the Soviet advocacy of the spread of communism through violence, which communists over the world saw as a betrayal to the principles of a communist revolution"
